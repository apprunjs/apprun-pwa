## AppRun Template for PWA Apps


This app uses the service worker code from [PWA Builder](https://www.pwabuilder.com).

Modify docs/sw.js to define pre-cached files, cache-first files and network-first files.

> The docs folder is for publishing the app to GitHub Pages.

* Use _npm start_ to start the dev server
* Use _npm run build_ to build for production

This is an application built with [AppRun](https://github.com/yysun/apprun).
